# RPG Battle Script

This is project number 2 on [The Complete Python 3 Course: Beginner to Advanced!](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-complete/) course in [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/).<br/>
<br/>
It's a simple [RPG Battle game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-playing_game)  I made in Python to practice Object Oriented Programin in Python. <br/>
You have 3 players and 3 enemys, the goal is to kill al the enemys and not get killed in the process!<br/>
Each turn you have to choose between 3 actions:
- Attack
- Magic
- Items<br/>

Each action has it's benefits. <br/>
